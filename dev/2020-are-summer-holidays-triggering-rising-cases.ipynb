    "(i) people's perception of the danger from COVID19 has changed after the first wave has passed, and social distancing and hygene measures may not be taken as seriously as before. This will increase the R number which reflects how many people one infected person can infect, and could explain such an increase. \n",

    "If the holidays season is to blame for the increase, do we expect the numbers of new cases to start growing immediately when the holidays start? No: first people need to travel and return (we can assume one or two weeks for this to take place), and they also need to develop symptoms and be tested - so a delay by a few weeks is probably expected. Similarly, we don't expect numbers to decrease immediately at the end of the holidays, but with a few weeks delay (as people who return from travel on the last day of their holidays, may still take one or two weeks to develop symptoms, be tested, and the test be reported).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots of the new cases per day for each Bundesland can be confusing because they have different y-scales. We show absolute numbers here, and scale the y-axis so that the line fills the available space. This allows to see trends, but the impact for infections numbers in Germany overall will depend whether there are 100s of new cases as in Nordrhein-Westfalen or Bavaria, or very few as in Thüringen. Their combined impact can be seen in the summed data for Germany overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we expect the R-value and the number of new infections to drop again when the holiday season is completed (i.e. the middle of September)? If the hypothesis that the travel activity associated with the summer holidays is causing the increased number of new infections, then this would be expected (with a few weeks delay). However, other changes may be taking place the same time: for example the opening of the schools may have an effect. \n",
